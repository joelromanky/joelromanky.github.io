Hello :wave:,

I am a PhD Candidate in Computer Science from [University of Lorraine](https://www.univ-lorraine.fr/) and an Engineer :mortar_board: graduated from [Toulouse INP-ENSEEIHT](https://www.enseeiht.fr/fr/index.html) in Computer Science and Telecommunications :computer:.  
I did my preparatory classes at CPGE Mohamed V in Casablanca, Morocco.
I went to a special high school, a military one :cop:, the [Prytanée Militaire de Kadiogo](https://www.pmk-bf.net/). I got my high school diploma there as well as military training certificates.  

My work interests are Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Statistics. I am strongly interested in Research and Development in these fields.  
Beyond work, I'm a huge fan of Japanese manga :japanese_ogre: and piano :musical_keyboard:. I also like volley-ball and e-gaming :video_game:.
