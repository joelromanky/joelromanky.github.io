## Bio

Hello :wave:,  

I am a **Postdoctoral Researcher in Trustworthy AI** at the [Université du Luxembourg – Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT)](https://www.uni.lu/snt-en/), under the supervision of [Dr. Maxime Cordy](https://maxcordy.github.io/). My research focuses on **machine learning robustness**, **explainable AI (XAI)**, and **tabular data**.  

I earned my **PhD in Computer Science** from the [University of Lorraine](https://www.univ-lorraine.fr/) in collaboration with [Orange Innovation](https://www.orange.com/fr), under the supervision of [Prof. Isabelle Chrisment](), [Prof. Raouf Boutaba](), [Dr. Abdelkader Lahmadi](), and [Dr. Bertrand Mathieu]().  

:mortar_board: I graduated from [Toulouse INP-ENSEEIHT](https://www.enseeiht.fr/fr/index.html) with an **engineering degree in Computer Science and Telecommunications**, and also obtained a **Master’s degree** from [Toulouse INP](https://www.inp-toulouse.fr/fr/index.html).  

I completed my preparatory classes at **CPGE Mohamed V** in **Casablanca, Morocco**. Before that, I attended a special high school, a military one :cop:, the [Prytanée Militaire de Kadiogo](https://www.pmk-bf.net/), where I earned both my **high school diploma** and **military training certificates**.  

My PhD research focused on the **classification and troubleshooting of Cloud Gaming applications**, and more broadly on **low-latency applications**. This work was carried out with the [RESIST](https://team.inria.fr/resist/) research team at the [LORIA](https://www.loria.fr/fr/) lab, and supported by [Orange Innovation](https://www.orange.com/fr) through a [CIFRE contract](https://www.anrt.asso.fr/fr/le-dispositif-cifre-7844).  

My interests lie in **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, and **Statistics**. I am deeply motivated by **Research and Development**, especially when it comes to exploring new ideas and solving real-world problems through intelligent systems.  

Beyond work, I'm a huge fan of **Japanese manga** :japanese_ogre: and a passionate **pianist** :musical_keyboard:. I also enjoy **volleyball**, **ping-pong**, **badminton**, and **e-gaming** :video_game:.
